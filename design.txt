Design Assumptions:
1.	The Data in the excel files is always correct and in the right format as such the application might fail if the data is not well formatted.
2.	When the traffic delay is accounted for, the distance between to point is increased by traffic delay.
Development Approach:
1.	Build on spring-boot, JPA.
2.	Implemented algorithm is Dijkstra greedy algorithm.
3.	The algorithm is applied on the undirected graph, this means the graph can be traversed in both directions.
4.	Two tables are created, the other tables, contain references which is just node names and planets names as well their entity Id. 
5.	Another table is constructed to describe distance between two nodes as well as the traffic delay.
6.	Origin and destination are represented as integers this become useful for construction of the graph. 
Front-End:
1.	Front end is build using angular framework and scss styling.
